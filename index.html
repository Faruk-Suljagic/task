                    When he was appointed ambassador to Fiji, M. Osman Siddique
                    imagined waving the U.S. flag with one hand while holding a
                    piña colada in the other. How could he have known the dream
                    job would land him in the middle of a paramilitary coup?
                    It’s just one more enthralling chapter in the remarkable
                    life of a Bangladeshi immigrant who came to the United
                    States to find the American dream. And find it, he did.
                    First as a hugely successful entrepreneur, and then as
                    America’s first serving Muslim ambassador. Through it all,
                    he gained an appreciation for the U.S. unique to those who
                    come to the country from elsewhere, an appreciation for the
                    freedoms established by the Founding Fathers and guaranteed
                    by the Constitution—“The miracle of America.”

                    Leaps of Faith: An Immigrant’s Odyssey of Struggle, Success,
                    and Service to his Country is the delightful memoir of a man
                    humbled by the possibilities of his new land and by the
                    opportunities he discovered—in business, in love, in family,
                    and, ultimately, in government service. Ambassador Siddique
                    reflects on his past, and looks to the future—his future and
                    the future of America. In the turbulent seas of our times,
                    can America continue to be the beacon of hope for the world
                    that it was to him?

              M. Osman Siddique is America's first serving Muslim ambassador and
              chief of mission. Born in East Pakistan, Ambassador Siddique was
              witness to the violent birth of a new country as East Pakistan
              became Bangladesh. Seeking the promise and opportunity of the
              United States, he left Bangladesh to complete his academic studies
              at Indiana University in the heartland of America. After a stint
              with a Fortune 500 company, he became a prolific entrepreneur and,
              most proudly, an American citizen.

              Following the 2000 Fijian paramilitary coup, Ambassador Siddique
              played a critical role in the restoration of democracy and the
              rehabilitation of that country.
